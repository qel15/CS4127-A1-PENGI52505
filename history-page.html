                <div class="border">
                    <p>An ancient and famous folktale tells us that Singapore, or Singapura as it is called in Malay,
                a Malay Prince by the name of Sang Nila Utama was shipwrecked with his crew on the island back
                when it was known as Temasek and witnessed what they believed was a lion, which is how Singapore
                got its name as the word "Singa" translates to lion in Malay. However, legends aside, The history
                    of the modern state of Singapore dates back to its founding in the early 19th century; however,
                    evidence suggests that a significant trading settlement existed on the island in the 14th century.
                    The last ruler of the Kingdom of Singapura, Parameswara, was expelled by the Majapahit or the Siamese
                    before he founded Malacca. Singapore then came under the Malacca Sultanate and subsequently the Johor
                    Sultanate. In 1819, British statesman Stamford Raffles negotiated a treaty whereby Johor would allow
                    the British to locate a trading port on the island, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Crown
                    colony of Singapore in 1867. Important reasons for the rise of Singapore were its nodal position at the
                    tip of the Malay Peninsula flanked by the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the presence of a natural sheltered
                    harbour, as well as its status as a free port.</p>

                <div class="border">
                    <p>This unfortunate event happened in the year 1965 where Singapore was separated from Malaysia and became its own
            independent and sovereign state, caused by certain economic and political differences between the two, which also
                led to racial riots in July and September 1964. At the press conference that declared the separation,
            the prime minister at the time, Lee Kuan Yew, was overwhelmed with emotions and broke down as he had a vision
            to merge Malaysia and Singapore and believed that the union would benefit both countries in so many ways. He
            envisioned what people at that time called a "Malaysian Malaysia," where everyone would be treated equally with
            the same rights, creating a prosperous society.</p>

                    <p>In mid-1965, due to growing tensions in Malaysia, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to separate
                Singapore from the federation to avoid further clashes. Deputy Prime Minister Tun Razak was told to
                gain support for this decision. By August, it was clear that Singapore's separation was inevitable.
                Secret talks took place in the days leading up to August 9, with Singapore's Finance Minister
                Goh Keng Swee negotiating with Razak. Singapore's Law Minister, E.W. Barker, drafted the agreement,
                which was reluctantly signed by Singapore’s leaders, who were concerned about potential unrest. On August 8,
                Lee Kuan Yew returned to Singapore to finalize the agreement, and on August 9, Singapore officially became independent.</p>
